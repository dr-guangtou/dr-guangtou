### Hi there, this is [Song Huang (黄崧)](https://dr-guangtou.github.io/) 👋

- I am a post-doc researcher in astrophysics at the [Department of Astrophysical Sciences](https://web.astro.princeton.edu/) of Princeton University now, and will be a new assistant professor at the newly minted [Department of Astronomy at Tsinghua University](http://astro.tsinghua.edu.cn/) in Beijing, China.
- I am studying _galaxy formation_ and _galaxy-halo connection_ through observations. In particular, I am now focusing on the life stories of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.

- 🔭 I’m currently a member of the [Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program (HSC SSP; or HSC survey)](https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/). It is an ambitious imaging survey using the new prime focus camera on the 8.2m Subaru telescope.

- 🌱 A few things I am working on ...
  * [taotie](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/taotie): A curated collection of resources for astrophysical research.
  * [unagi](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/unagi): A tool to help you use the amazing public data from the HSC survey.
  * [dsigma](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/dsigma): A pure-python galaxy-galaxy lensing framework.
    - Please also see the [much improved version 2.0](https://github.com/johannesulf/dsigma) by [Johannes Lange](https://github.com/johannesulf)
  * [kungpao](https://github.com/dr-guangtou/kungpao): Codes I have been using for analysing galaxy images.
